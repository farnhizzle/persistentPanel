# PersistentPanel - the panel that won't quit

A simple jQuery plugin for creating panels that remember whether they are open
or closed. Allows custom animations but has sensible defaults.

 - Creates a panel that opens and closes, vertically or horizontally, when a toggler element
is clicked
 - Remembers last state a user left the panel in and use that on page reload
 - Easy to use with defaults - just $('#somediv').persistentPanel();
 - You can pass in custom animations, cookie names, etc.

## Usage Examples

      <td> 
        Whether to replace the contents of your specified toggler
        element with the contents of togglerContentsOpen and
        togglerContentsClosed when it your panel is opened and closed,
        respectively. If you set this to false, the togglerContents
        settings will not be used and the toggler element's contents will
        not be modified.

      <td>closeFunction</td>
      <td>(depends on openDirection)</td>
      <td>Any jquery animation for hiding</td>
      <td>
       If you don't specify this, a default will be chosen based on the
       openDirection (which also has its own default). If you do specify a
       closeFunction, it should accept a duration parameter. This is for two
       reasons:
       <ul>
         <li>Your duration setting will be passed to this function</li>
         <li>On page load, if the panel should be closed, this function will be
         called with a duration of 0 (meaning "close instantly").</li>
       </ul>

    <tr>
      <td>cookieName</td>
      <td>'persistentPanel'</td>
      <td>Any string</td>
      <td>
        The name of the cookie to set and check for this panel. If two
        panels use the same cookie name (and if neither of them has this
        options specified, they will both use the default), toggling one
        of them will affect whether the other is open or closed on page
        load. If you have a single panel that you display on multiple
        pages, it should use the same cookie name on each page.

      <td>'open' <br/> 'closed'</td>

        If no cookie is set, should the panel start out open or
        closed?

        Is used to determine default values for openFunction,
        closeFunction, togglerContentsOpen and togglerContentsClosed. If
        you provide your own values for all of those, this setting does
        nothing. (Note: opening 'up' and 'left' is currently identical to
        opening 'down' or 'right'.)

        Which element, when clicked, should open and close your
        panel? Note: I **strongly** recommend that you use an ID for this
        selector; you may have more than one panel on the screen at some
        point, and you don't want multiple togglers to affect the same panel.
        (If you're using the same ID more than once per page, you're Doing 
        It Wrong.)

        By default, this function uses the jQuery.cookie plugin. If you
        don't want this dependency, pass in your own function. It should:
        <ul>
          <li>Accept cookieName as a parameter, so that the panel can
          request the correct cookie for itself</li>
          <li>Return the string value of the cookie</li>

      <td>A function to set the cookie in the cookieName option - see
        description</td>
      <td>
        By default, this function uses the jQuery.cookie plugin. If you
        want to customize what it does - for example, set a domain for
        your cookie - refer to the jQuery.cookie plugin documentation in 
        the source code. It is quite well-written.<br/>
        For example, you could pass in the following:<br/>
        <code>function(cookieName, value) {$.cookie(cookieName, value, { expires: 7, path: '/', domain: 'jquery.com', secure: true});}</code>
        
        <br/>
        If you don't want the dependency on jQuery.cookie, pass in your own function. It should:
        <ul>
          <li>
          Accept cookieName as the first parameter, so that the panel can set the correct cookie for itself
          </li>
          <li>
          Accept value as the second parameter, so that the panel can
          indicate whether it should be set to 'open' or 'closed'
          </li>
        </ul>

## nonPersistentPanel() - Everything except persistence

If you want to use the other functionality of persistentPanel - the
animation, the toggler contents, etc - but do NOT want your panel to remember
its state when the page is reloaded, it's easy: call
$('#someElement').nonPersistentPanel();
